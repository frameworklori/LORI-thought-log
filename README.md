# LORI-HEDA — Human Emotional & Decision Authority

In the age where AI replaces labor, optimization, and even thought,
the last authority that remains uniquely human is the ability to define meaning.

This repository records the principles, logic, and emotional infrastructures
required for humans to maintain identity sovereignty, emotional grounding,
and narrative authorship in virtual and AI-mediated environments.

This is not resistance to AI.
This is the continuation of being human.
